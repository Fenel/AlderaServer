# Aldera Server
Archival project of my 2d MMORPG game server. Project was created around year 2009 and was continuously updated till beginning of year 2015. Project has been retired because of certain big parts of code written in not-so-good style (I don't have much time now to refactor old hobbyist code), during early years of my programming life. I'll focus on creating smaller apps from scratch, but properly coded using all my abilities learned in recent few years.
